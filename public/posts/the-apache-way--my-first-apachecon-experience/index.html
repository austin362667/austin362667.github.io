    <h1>The Apache Way – My First ApacheCon Experience</h1>

    

    <p><a href="https://asia.communityovercode.org/">Apache CommunityOverCode Asia</a></p>
<p>My journey into the world of open source began with a leap of faith, a ticket to my first ApacheCon, and a heart filled with excitement and curiosity. As I stepped into the vibrant conference hall, I was immediately struck by the energy and passion radiating from every corner. The Apache Way was more than just a philosophy; it was a living, breathing community of dedicated individuals united by a common belief in the power of collaboration and innovation.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, I immersed myself in a whirlwind of keynotes, sessions, and workshops. The speakers were luminaries in their respective fields, sharing insights, experiences, and lessons learned from years of contributing to Apache projects. I was amazed by the diversity of projects, from the widely-usedApache Kafka to cutting-edge initiatives like Apache Fury and Apache Gravitino.</p>
<p>One of the most inspiring aspects of ApacheCon was the sense of community. Attendees from all walks of life and backgrounds came together to share their knowledge, collaborate on ideas, and build meaningful connections. The Apache Way emphasized the importance of inclusivity, transparency, and consensus-driven decision-making. I witnessed firsthand how this collaborative approach fostered a culture of innovation and excellence.</p>
<p>Beyond the formal sessions, the social events at ApacheCon provided ample opportunities for networking and relationship-building. I met contributors from around the world, representing different organizations and industries. The conversations I had sparked new ideas and opened doors to future collaborations. The Apache Way extended beyond the conference walls, creating a truly global community of open source enthusiasts.</p>
<p>My first ApacheCon was a transformative experience that left an indelible mark on my professional and personal journey. I returned home with a renewed sense of purpose, inspired by the Apache Way and eager to contribute to the open source movement. Whether it was through code contributions, documentation improvements, or community engagement, I was determined to give back and be a part of something bigger than myself.</p>
<p>The lessons I learned at ApacheCon have stayed with me throughout my career. The Apache Way taught me the value of collaboration, the importance of community, and the power of open source to drive innovation and make the world a better place. I&rsquo;m grateful for the opportunity to have experienced ApacheCon and to have become a part of the Apache community.</p>
